# streamlit_double_sidebar
This code provides a workaround to simulate a double sidebar layout in Streamlit, which natively supports only one sidebar. It uses custom CSS styling to position filters on both the left and right sides of the main content area.

However, this approach isn't fully foolproof, as the layout might break on different screen sizes or with future Streamlit updates.
